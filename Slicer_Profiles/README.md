# V0 Slicer Files:

## PrusaSlicer

[VoronV0.ini](./PrusaSlicer/VoronV0.ini) is exported from the built in V0 SuperSlicer configuration and manually edited to be compatible with PrusaSlicer.

- Note: 

     If using Firefox you can right click the "VoronV0.ini" link and choose "Save link as.." to easily download the config file without downloading the entire repo.
        
     If you are using Chrome or Chromium based browsers you're better off copying the contents of the file and pasting them into a text file.
